  <h1>Some Actual Deep Thinking With Lesley</h1>

      I've sat thinking this over for sometime now. Pun intended and unintended. Really though, I have thought over what to do for this since last Sunday. I really wanted to do another video blog for this; however, the cold from hell knocked me over. I was able to analyze errors, but I knew no one wanted to watch me cough and hack my way through explaining my bizarre thought processes. By now you may have noticed that I'm out there. At least within the last couple of years, I've come into seeing myself as 'out there' or wondering if I ever noticed just how weird I can act sometimes. Apparently, I've always been in some sort of demanding mind set. As a child, according to my parents, I took no prisoners on the playground. Saying "I'm sorry" was not my specialty. I should put those sayings on t-shirts. Then puberty came, I became awkward, and now I feel like I'm become an odd mixture of those two past Lesleys.

      I'm a Leo. I read astrology things for fun when I come across them. I identify with Leo and Virgo -ish ways. It is the same way with my <b>Gregorc Mind style</b>. I am mainly an <b>Abstract Sequential</b> (I'll call this AS) thinker. I noticed some similarities between Leo traits and AS traits. Mainly, I need to be heard, but I like learning by myself, not being restricted, and "sentimental" thinking. That last part is especially true since I always found sentimental moments gag worthy. You will NOT find a quote about love, laughing, or dreaming in my apartment. I prefer quotes from Winston Churchill, Abraham Lincoln, and the movie <i>The Big Lebowski</i>. I also identify with <b>Abstract Random</b> thinking (AB). I like harmony, have a hard time accepting any type of criticism, dislike working with unfriendly people, and concentrating on one thing at a time. I have to justify everything to myself and through others, but at the same time play my own note. So even my mind is still an enigma to itself. It feels like asking 'What came first? Chicken or the egg?'

      Pairing has been great practice at getting out what I am thinking. Coding was very much a personal and internal thing for me until DBC. I didn't have to verbalize how I thought div layers need to be positioned - I just <i>did</i> it. This is forcing me to put out those thoughts, and in a way, attempt to organize them into a logical manner. DBC's way of teaching and guidelines feels in-line with my style of thinking and life. You get so used to a certain way of schooling, especially with college. The only time I felt that was broken was during my tutorial class at my time at Oxford. It was on British Parliament, and it was once a week with just me and a professor. I admire how Oxford has kept with this system for their students on some of their classes. DBC in a way has mirrored it, and you get more of a look into you as person and how you learn rather than 'you better learn it this way or you're shit outta luck.' I did decently well in college. I always liked to say the things I was good at were school and faking sick to get out of school. This is showing me that I might have been bending myself to fit a style of thought that wasn't me rather than find a way that really teaches me. 


    <p>I could go on for hours with this subject. Mindsets, thinking, and non-conformity. Actually, enough to make me hate myself. As suggested, however, I'll time box and cut myself off here. The rest will be for another time and further reflection. This wasn't often brought up in finance, so it feels almost like a side of me was surpressed for some time. Last thing I will mention is that at the end of my first job after college, I had some co-worker-ish-friends who said "We always thought you didn't like us that much." I was SHOCKED. I always loved being with them! Since that time, I worry about the emotions that are portrayed across my face are never actually what are going on in my mind. Working in groups and with others again is bringing this back to mind, and I feel like I should come with a caution sign: 'USUALLY HAS REALLY GOOD INTENTIONS EVEN IF IT SEEMS LIKE SHE MAY DISLIKE YOU.' I very rarely hate anyone. There are a couple out there though.

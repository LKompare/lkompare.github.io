      As I usually like to, I'll start off with a quote on what THE Ruby on Rails site says to <i>What is Rails?</i>: 
      <blockquote>"Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun." Source: <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">Rails Guide</a></blockquote> 
      So to someone who has been programming in JUST Ruby without a framework, I think that sounds pretty darn cool. Plus, who doesn't like FUN?! Plus it is open source, meaning that you are allowed to take it and use to to create even more possible fun applications and software. It allows you to integerate Ruby with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
    </p>

      It follows great guidelines like DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself), usual code implemented so you can focus on the code that needed to be created which is what they call 'Convention of Configuration.' It can allow you to create complex websites where you need a database involved much easier than other methods. You can implement code that will take over repetitive and time eating tasks. Maybe say that you can create complex software much more quickly with rails. An example of Ruby on Rails in action is Groupon. Part of their software is Ruby on Rails and a good way of how it can be used in collaboration with other codes.

       It is a full stack framework so essentially you could do it all with RoR if you so wished. You can bring the various parts of the software to work together 'seamlessly', and there for hopefully run faster and have a more readable code. It comes with built-in testing! That's pretty nice. You can also make your own tests through a relatively easier to build. It was created in 2009, so it is a middle child these days in the tech world. Languages and frameworks seem to come out so often, but it depends on which ones stick and prove their worth. Ruby on Rails luckily has and to some is a must-have skill to put in your tech bank. David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator of Rails, said he was looking for a way to have a language that didn't feel as "dirty" as PHP. He felt PHP was too repetitive.

      You can access Ruby on Rails via Ruby gems, which you use your command line to install. Since we were working on our own cheat sheets earlier, here's another to add to your library from Dave Child: <a href="http://www.cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/ruby-on-rails/"> Ruby on Rails Cheat Sheet</a>.

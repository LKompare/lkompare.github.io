      I wanted to do a big video on this to ask people about their stereotypes of computer coders, programming, and everything in between. However, my lack of good equipment stopped me from being able to make it decent. This subject is a really big thing for me, since I feel like I subconsciously put pressure on myself due to stereotypes about women, coding, and that I won't be taken seriously. It makes me feel like I need to try extra hard to prove myself, or I start to get really unsure of myself that I can reach that "potential" my mind has set for itself.

      It was interesting in the video from Claude M. Steele, "Identity and Stereotype", I found myself understanding things even more. Especially how men with can handle when they don't know something, and women were less capable due to the study they did. When I get stuck, I get a block in my head. I'm unsure to where to go, even if I spend hours trying to figure something out. It's happened in DBC, and I feel like I'd be fine and have an 'oooh' moment if I got a push in the right direction. However, when I'm left to my own devices, my mind freaks out, says "there's no way you're getting this on your own", and my nerves basically put me at a stand still. It is something I really want to overcome so I can really learn, and know I can become very confident in my knowledge of new programming languages I'm studying. I don't know where I indentify myself with all of this. I also thought I was very tech savy, but DBC has been a wake up call. I feel while all of us in the program I would say are way ahead of most of the population now in terms of our computer knowledge, I still worry that I won't be good enough for the tech world, or that I will need to prove myself ten times more than I thought I would have to be taken seriously.

      I think reading about this topics has shown me how important it is to connect with other female coders, and keep an open dialogue about this. One thing I like about DBC is that it is connected with some great female coding groups, and has mentors of all kinds to keep us going and motivate us to learn and grow. So, I definitely feel it. I relate about the anxiety of not being taken seriously. I'm really hoping that the industry will change, and that in the future, I will grow my confidence and know not to doubt myself.

      Ruby classes are the containers in ruby. They can pack a bunch of methods up, keep them together, and run through it with simple commands. They keep things organized, and when you need to fix things later on, you'll have an easier time working with one direct chunk of the code. Sandi Metz put is similarly in her book <i> Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</i>, by saying that deciding first what will go in your classes can be tough, but to make it easy break it down as much as you.  Her definition of a class is:
      <blockquote>"A class should do the smallest possible useful thing; that is, it should have a single responsibility" pg. 17</blockquote>
      She uses the example of a bike throughout her book as an example, and points out that you break it down to its parts like you would anything else. She uses the class 'Gears'. I understand and I do agree with her idea that classes should be used in way that the code can easily be read later on. It will keep things running smoother or at least a little easier to manage. I haven't biked all winter, so I'm going to make a different example.

        I like to paint with spray paint, so I easily have a ton of cans of different colors. I'll stare at them and not be able to make a decision. So to help me, I put together a tiny class example that will chose a color for me.  This is basic example of how classes work. You can see below that I enter colors I was considering, and it would give an output. I added in that you can ask how many were given. This should be an easy class to read for beginners. It is also something that can have other methods added on to it!

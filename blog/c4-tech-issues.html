  <h1>OK, So We'll Sorta Talk About Our Problems</h1>
  <h2>Well, my take on a problem and how I'm going to approach it</h2>

      So every article that I have come across for problems the tech industry is facing is about diversity. It is the first thing that came to mind, but since it is, I thought it would be interesting to focus on something different. Problem is - there are only really two big stories about actual problems - AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF SCREENS BEING BREAKABLE, POPSUGAR (Geez.) - gender and privacy vs. security. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel I could say a lot about both of these. I'm a feminist, so yes, I could write a blog post all about the gigantic gender gap. But how many times do we need to read about? I always thought it was that women just though tech was A LOT of math, didn't like to code, thought it 'too nerdy', or just weren't directed towards it in the beginning. I never thought about women leaving the tech industry. 
    </p>

        I'm interested to enter it and see what all the hype is about. This is my opinion, but I come from finance. If you want to talk about an 'OLD BOYS CLUB', damn guys, I found one. Women in finance are few, but not as few as tech. I was either the only girl in my small company, or one of three women in my dept in my larger companies. A lot of dudes but in suits. It actually wasn't them that I often felt 
        offended by.  <i>IT WAS THE CLIENTS</i>.

      <p>***WARNING, RANT COMING***
       I AM NOT YOUR GIRL FRIDAY NOR THE SECRETARY, AND YES I AM LICENSED TO HELP YOU.
       <BR>***OK. OPEN YOUR EYES***

       <P>
       So yes, I had clients ask to speak to someone else, because they thought I wasn't qualified to give them stock information, sell stock, etc, because I just happened to be a girl who picked up their phone call at the brokerage desk. No other reason.
       </P>
       <p>
       In tech, I will likely not be working directly with clients. I hope not. I have had my fill, and it really does make you hate the human population sometimes. <i>No, Gertrude, I'm sorry our website isn't working, BUT IT IS NOT BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE.</i> True story. We had to deal with being the IT desk for the brokerage dept too, and helping someone over the phone realize they just need to download an adobe update or to refresh their computer. It kills the tech-lover side of  me. That is why I am coming to Dev Bootcamp. I want make things, I want to code, I want to design. 
       </p>
       <p>
       Sexism, no sexism. I'm not going to let it stop me from doing what I like or from a career I want. It isn't why I left finance. I left finance, because I decided I like computers better. So I'm doing this for the 'puters' and looking at a forward looking culture as a plus. It would be nice if it would like to include me in it. I like to get a long. Hey Tech Industry, I'm Lesley. I've been a fan for awhile, and I'm really hoping we can be friends. Like really good friends.

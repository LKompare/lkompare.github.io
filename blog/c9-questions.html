       How you forumlate questions isn't a thing that comes to mind often. People do not ask themselves 'Is there a better way to google this?' Instead, they type whatever comes to mind and simply hope that it'll return what they need. However, they could be missing out on vital resources that could give a more direct or helpful answer to what they seek. This is especially true when trying to find out syntax, error answers, and general questions for various computer languages and development.

        The content of what you search for has a lot to do with it. You must keep in mind that there are certain key phrases and words people build in to make their sites more searchable. SEO or search engine optimization is big these days as sites fight to have a higher standing in engine results. You can play off these as a way to weed out what you do not need and what you do need. Start off mainly with what language you need to find results for, then possibly the platform, operating system, version, and constraints. Spelling used to be a major problem, but it is not AS important since sites like Google have auto spell check. However, it is still best to make sure your search titles are spelled correctly.

        Now, there are other times when you need to formulate questions. Such as seeking help on Stack Overflow, asking for help in a web community, or merely emailing someone. I know I've run into problems when not stating fully what I needed help on. It is important to make sure that you are verbose in your sample coding. Give a good snippet to show what you have, and then detail what are you looking to do. Make sure to say the language type, any necessary syntax indicators such as if something is a string or you are working with arrays, say what version of the language you are using, and also double check your grammar. Keep an eye on your questions so that if any answers come in, you can respond and also make sure that people understand what you are seeking.

       It is also important to note that you should not make your question novel sized. Keep it concise and to the point. People usually do not have all day to sit and read twenty paragraphs about your new application. Instead, if you need help on a section, try to break it down into a small paragraph and sample of the problem you're facing or code you are having trouble with. Stack Overflow has a great article on how to include a proper example to help aid in getting an answer. You can find it <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">here</a>.

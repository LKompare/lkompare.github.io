  <h2>Object-Oriented vs. Functional: At Each Other's Throats</h2>

        I started reading a lot about object-oriented design (OOD) while reading Sandi Metz's book <i>Practical Object-Oriented Design In Ruby</i>. It seemed to be a very well layed out idea and concept of building up programs. Functional came before OOD, when languages like APL were born. OOD essentially came from seeing short comings of functional, but there are many others that say OOD is merely an unnecessary child of functional. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As still being new to such languages, I have yet to pass my own judgement. I do like the clarity of OOD, and I can see the ease of how it could be friendly when going back to make changes. Supporters of functional say that OOD gives too much freedom, that it gives too much to work with, and there for drags programmers down. Then there are other's like Michael Feathers during his <a href="https://youtu.be/UX7xmhpUoi4" target=new>'Ruby Arrays on Steriods'</a> talk, who said that this argument is invalid because obviously programming hasn't gone into chaos. Arguments against OOD say that is anti-declaritive (allowing a database, but you can't query it), calls for repetitive code (despite DRY), and that abstraction can go too far. To me, it feels like the philosophical type of programming. Arguments against functional and for OOD is that OOD allows debugging much more easily, allows for coding without fine detailing, and that it kicks out any programmer who doesn't want to program with a mathmatical mindset. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Functional programming is said that there was nothing wrong with it, that it still is fine with debugging, and the biggest one I found is that it avoids 'states': the value of an element is always predetermined by the input. Others say you can program more elegantly (I didn't know I need to bring a ball gown to DBC), and if this may be an argument against or for it in different eyes, the 'hipster of programming.' Yes, it was starting to get out done by all the OOD languages popping up that it became "cool" to do functional programming. I can see that it definitely has its many uses, and in certain type of problems could out weigh OOD. 
    <P>
        Either way, I see it beneficial to learn OOD and functional if you please. Some say it is too hard to teach OOD and others say functional has a deep, deep learning curve.  You have to start somewhere. I like the idea of freedom and being able to turn code as I please, so even if I only have done OOD, I can say I feel a lot more inclinded towards it. I like abstract and concrete at the same time, but still with room for creativity. The debate is very A vs B, Red vs Blue, Yankees vs Red Sox. They both have their upsides and downsides, but I think you come out on top if you get both of them to play in your league correctly.

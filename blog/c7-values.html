      I had a time in my life when I had to do something just like this. I'm not going to talk to you all about and get weird, but yeah. I'm pretty versed in 'values.'  Truth is,
      I get bad anxiety sometimes. It sucks, but everyone gets it once in awhile. Panic attacks, though, are not fun. Not at all. Values can help with all of this while you remember 'Hey, what is important to me?'

      I have a lot - aka I'm very indecisive. I tend to lean towards <i>Friendship</i> (is magic ~~rainbowwwssss), <i>inner harmony</i>, <i>self confidence</i>, and <i>personal development</i>. I like to improve upon myself, but sometimes I have to reel back on that and say 'Lesley, you tried, you DO NOT have to be the best at EVERYTHING.' Over the last year, I've come to really appreciate things like inner harmony and confidence. They're hard things to keep when your mind wants to ruin everything. However, meditation does help. I'm not joking. I know. It sounds lame, but guys - seriously. If you can really get yourself to sit down and try it for even 5 or 10 minutes, you'll feel at least *a little* more -- hmm, whats the word -- at peace? It can take practice,so if you're like me, guided meditations are the best to keep your mind flowing.

      It is great to be positive, but one thing I've learned is that you have to accept the negativity too without letting it get to you TOO much. It is really, really, really hard. Usually, it is your mind that is making you feel that way. So if you can accept negative thoughts, but then just sort of let them drift onwards over the horizon, it helps. Don't grab and hold on to them. You acknowledge it, remember 'Oh, that's my mind - thanks for the stupid warning mind', then let it go on. It is an oddly abstract and tough skill. However, it is a way to keep yourself from tumbling down the mountain that is anxiety.

      I know I've been trying to use all of these through out Phase 0 of DBC so far. I'll probably have to use them even more once on-site comes. Life will go on no matter what, and hey, flowing with it can make things easier. I've had a wild weird adventure this past year - it has taken me through a couple jobs, to an island, down a netflix hole, and now to DBC! It really matters what is important to you and how you act or hold on to it. I've learned that life direction and having creative outlets are very important to me. Hence art and marrying my other past love, designing and coding things. I thought a lot about work and life, what the two meant, how did I want to live my life, etc. I decided that I really wanted to find a career that let me have some enjoyment since we spend so much time at our jobs. I didn't want to spend 40+ hours a week hating life. So that is why I'm here at DBC, changing my entire industry, and taking on a whole new life path. I'd love a job where I'm able to change things up, bring in ideas, and be with like-minded people.

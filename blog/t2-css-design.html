      I usually feel pretty drained when I reach time to do my tech blog. Mosly after sitting here for hours battling with CSS and finding syntax errors, I'd like a break. However, my tech thoughts must be brought to the world. I did learn a lot this week.

        I would like to learn even more about positioning: absolute, static, fixed, sticky, relative. <i>I understand me. Slightly</i> Do you ever have a few topics where it just seems to take awhile to sink in? These are definitely one of them for me. They are basically trying to position different blocks of color or content on site, but each category has different properties. Those properties can then mess with everything else around it, thus creating sometimes a frustrating situation.

        I can tell you, however, about margins, padding, and borders. Like positioning, they're very good things to know. Dev tools in Chrome has given me a better idea about it, so I'm feel pretty cool right now. 

        A MARGIN - is kind of what you think it would be. Like in Word or other text editors, your margins are on the side of your text. 

        Now think of your text is in a invisible block. A Border would be directly around that block. In most designs, we put it at 0 pixels so it won't even show up. 

        Padding, on the other hand, is the weird sister of the bunch. Take that pretend border around your Word document text and increase the space. Say you had 10 pixels of padding. This would add space INSIDE the border and push the text more into the middle. 

        There are great diagrams out there. Here is a great one from <a href="www.w3schools.com"> W3 schools</a>.

        I hope this helped you! I'm going to go let my brain decompress. Code on, my friends.

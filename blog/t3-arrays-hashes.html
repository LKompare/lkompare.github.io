        Arrays and Hashes. I know what you're thinking. Eggs and hash browns? No, we are talking about ruby arrays and ruby hashes. They are unedible as of this moment. Unless you 3D chocolate print out some code, then you could actually consume them. There are a lot of output jokes I could put in here, but for all of our sakes' I will let that one slide.

      <h2>Arrays</h2>
      <center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LEK7D.jpg" width=300></center>
      <BR>
        According to <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_arrays.htm">Tutorialspoint.com</a> arrays "are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. Each element in an array is associated with and referred to by an index." Say what? We'll we can take a look at what one looks like:<BR>

        <blockquote>array = [0,1,2,3] or varname = array["a", "b", "c"]</blockquote>
        <BR>
        It is a way to point at certain things, be it a string, an integer, or a float within a contained index. Like other languages, it starts counting at 0. So the first number above, which is 0, is position 0 in the array, then 1, then 2, and so on. The first one above ends at 3. You could also refer to it as '-1' since if you skip back to the end from zero, it would jump to the 3. 'A' in the second array is position 0, 'B' is 1, 'C' is 2 OR -1. It depends on how you are setting up your code with how you will refer to it .

        <h2>Hashes</h2>
        <BR>
        Now what is a hash, you ask? Let's go back to our friends at <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_hashes.htm">Tutorialspoint.com</a>. They say:<BR>

        <blockquote>"A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs like this: "employee" => "salary". It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index.</blockquote>
        <BR>

        See that difference? Did you spot it? Do you get it? If you said yes, pat yourself on the back. Hashes are indexed by words, phrases, or as they say 'keys.' They are not referenced by integers. So you do not point at it via 0, 1, 2 or 3. A hash can look like this:
        <BR><blockquote>
        awesome_points = { 
        "Lesley" => "a million", 
        "Judy Garland" => "so much more" }</blockquote>
        <BR>
        You can also type to make a key ' :lesley ' or ':judy_garland' or ':person_anything.' You can use the syntax 'do' to print them or other various things. Say you have a hash of items and prices, you can list them out. There are various ways to create hashes, and you can pick a favorite. There are {} hashes. There are variable_name = Hash.new, followed by variable_name[1] = "blahblah" variable_name[2] = "ewwwww", and so on. It can depend on preference or what type of hash or code you are trying to make. It also can depend on how concise you want to be, who may be reading your code, or things such as speed. They are good for database usages and also receiving feedback.

        This is all so exciting. I know. To make you feel better, here's an Ice Cube joke:

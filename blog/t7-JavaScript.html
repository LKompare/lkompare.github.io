      I'M GOING TO SAY. IT'S HAPPENING: <small>I kinda like javascript.</small> Alright, so maybe because I've had a tiny bit of exposure to it before, and it hasn't burned me as badly as Ruby has yet. KEYWORD YET. All in a day's learning, right? Ruby and Javascript are like cousins, but not cousins. As they say in Vietnam, 'Same same, but different.' Maybe I like Javascript since it is more front-end, and I do love some design being a self-declared creative type. However, it can be very fickle like working with unforgiving spray paint.

     This week I found myself often saying "Oh, this is just like *insertthinghere* in Ruby". Ruby Hashes and Javascript Objects are pretty similar. HOWEVER, very different syntax and Ruby gives you more room in creating your hashes. Javascript can be a little demanding on 'I WANT IT THIS WAY AND ONLY THIS WAY.'
     <BR>
     Let's look at a Ruby Hash:
     <blockquote>You can make them via Lesley = Hash.new,  Lesley = {}, then when it has contents it can looks like   Lesley = { "fun" => "woo", "way" => "cool"} OR Lelsey = { fun: "woo", way: "cool"} OR Lesley = {:fun => "woo", :way => "cool"}  The first words are keys and the second are values.
     </blockquote>

    So Ruby let you create and play with hashes in several different ways. You can also set up blocks when creating a hash and a lot more. I personally really like hashes more than arrays. I think I'm weird - does that make me weird? Maybe it's because they're readable for me in an odd way. They can contain lots of things or ALL the things if you want one just giant...terrible hash. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Javascript is waving its arms screaming "HEY, I GOT OBJECTS." Alright, let's look at some.
    <blockquote>They're easy to read, but you can only really create them as such
    var Lesley: { fun: "woo", way: "cool"};</blockquote>
    You have to declare it as a variable 'VAR' first, and that is also the main syntax for objects. But you can then dig in and easily call out the property to get its value. What did I mean there? A key is to Ruby as a property sort of is to Javascript. It associates with something and lets you access a string or integer. It is pretty easy to delete and add things to them, via 'delete lesley.fun;'  (sad face). DON'T FORGET YOUR SEMICOLONS! Alright, you don't need them ALL the time, but javascript can be weird where it'll have exceptions for that and where it will not. I say while you're learning, just bring a bag of them just in case -- just like how you should always carry a towel.

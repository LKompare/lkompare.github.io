       So after feeling like I climbed a small mountain, I must admit writting about it really is not something I want to do right now. However, for you all and for myself, I will grant you this initial tech blog post. Maybe at some point I'll switch it to a video blog, but we will see how things go.

        Version control. Yes, those words. They have been mentioned many a time over the last week, and DBC has done a good job at pounding it into our heads that a programmer's best friend is version control. You will want to know what it is, how to befriend it, invite it to parties, and become bossom buddies. Essentially, version control is to keep a history of your work on a certain project. You know all those updates you get for apps on your phone for version 1.14.3295 and all it will say is "bug fixes" or "SUPER UPDATE WITH ALL THE COOL THINGS"? There is version control right in front of your eyes. As you add a new program or new feature, you will encounter bugs after publishing that you will need to fix, so you will send a new version of the file to fix it. However, it is given a version name and description so you can go back and see exactly what you have done and fixed over the course of your work. It is so another person, very importantly, can go back and know exactly what you did and why you did it each time you made a change.

        One way you can do this is with git. Ahh, the glowing light of warmth that is git. You install it on your machine via Terminal, and with the magic words 'git log' it will bestow upon you all your changes and descriptions. 'Git status' will show you exactly where you and your files/changes are in the process of updating. So with these changes, where are we saving them? What if someone on the 15th floor of our building set a fire on purpose to get revenge on a boyfriend and we lost our computer and its files? That is when Github comes in. It is for much more than just a backup, but it is really nice to have all your changes, versions, and codes up in a nice little cloud where you can grab them whenever you want. Also, a potential group of teammates can grab them too. Your team and fiddle with them then send them back up, request you to look over, and vice versa. It is a great platform for sharing code, working with on a program with a team, or for simply keeping your tech adventures organized. Located at Github.com, you link it to your git via Terminal, and hope that everyone plays along - or then you make them play along with troubleshooting, frustration, and eventually an overwhelming feeling of relief that is making it over that small mountain.

                                        Bye for now, 
                                        Lesley.

  <h1>My Mind Hates Me</h1>
  <h2>Pairing, DBC, and Feedback</h2>

        The idea of pairing seemed like a good idea when I first heard it, but it also terrified me. I had only ever coded by myself, and I certainly never had anyone watching me while I did it. Trust me, it usually was not an entertaining show. The TV Pilot would never be picked up. However, I actually find that I do like it. I really learn from working with other people, and seeing what they bring up that never crossed my mind. I think it is fun to connect with someone who has a similar coding interest but then get down to it and solve a puzzle together. When I was younger, my friend and I would play these Nancy Drew mystery PC games. You went through stories, investigated things, and there were always crazy puzzles. None of us would really play apart, just when we gathered together because it was more fun to talk out the puzzles or have someone speak up with a "OH WAIT - I THINK I GOT IT." It was like a perfect primer for code pairing because it essentially was kinda the same thing just with a game instead of straight code. There are a lot of times I just want to code something by myself and go into my own world; however, that is definitely not all the time. I do find it fun and rewarding to see how so many different people think, how they learn, and then learn from them.

        I <i>knew</i> the hard part of DBC would be the feedback. I am really bad with criticism, positive or negative. It makes me anxious, I feel like I misunderstand it, and it makes me doubt myself. I'm a person who really like positivity and cohesion, but I know in reality you can't have that 100% of the time. I hate to think that, but I know it is the truth. It feels like I have to learn to swallow this tough pill, find away to turn it around and make it work for myself. 

      <p>My whole life I've compared myself to others in school and in career. It is only within this last year that I realized how heavily it was impacting me and how badly I needed to break from this mindset. Earlier this week, I had an anxious afternoon where I was constantly thinking 
      <blockquote>"<i>Am I behind everyone? Am I learning this correctly? Everyone else looks like they know so much more. What if I get held back? I won't be a dragonfly anymore - that'll be so embarrassing. What if I get kicked out? What will I do then? What if I'm not doing this kindly enough or with enough integrity or my whole self?"</i></blockquote>

      My mind can be a *$#&! to me (going to try to keep this somewhat family friendly). On the outside I may look really enthusiastic, which I think is a way of me trying to keep everything light hearted, fun, and positive. I am learning to take criticism on a positive note from the feedback. I think it helps knowing that I, too, have to give feedback and I know what is going through my mind when I write it. I never want to hurt anyone, take them down, or discourage them whatsoever. I like to help others, and I want my cohort to excel. I've begun to to try to keep this in mind when I read the feedback to know that the person probably has really good intentions for me. Writing feedback is easy when praising someone, but it is hard for me to give people actionable feedback. I don't like tension, grudges, or arguments. So with taking feedback, it is just as big of a battle to give it.

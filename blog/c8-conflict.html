      This is a tough topic from me. I have a terrible time dealing with conflict. I really am a person who always wants butterflies, rainbows, and unicorns in all types of relationships. I work well off of happy collaborations, a team that will joke around and get work done, people who can bring problems up in a very calm and nice manner. Harsh conflict drives up my anxiety, I shut down, and usually refuse to acknowledge it. I have gotten a lot better with this over the last year, but some instances have only made it worse when I did step up only to get shoved aside. Negative feedback and criticism really get to me. I feel motivated, pushed, and want to go farther when I receive positive feedback. Phase 0 has really been able to get me to get better with constructive feedback, rather than harsh criticism. Then again, engineering empathy and the A.S.K. model are an integral part of DBC and helping yourself grow and learn.

      I had numerous conflicts that I thought about using. I run away from a lot of them. Mostly from saying "I don't want this useless anxiety in my life." A big part of that was leaving finance, which I've talked about in a previous post. I've read a lot about anxiety - and numerous way to deal with it. I have gotten better with that. Stress of classwork though is a lot different than stress of a conflict situation. I usually view it as a conflict as a time to reflect on my relationship with that person, does that person make me want to be better or just worse, and is it a relationship I'm keeping myself in or is it a necessary one like co-worker relationship that you can not cut from your life. There are numerous I can think about my time in previous jobs, but usually, I know they would leave me ranting in this blog about how at times certain humans can just be terrible, irrational people. Even from my days at Starbucks, same thing. People with unrealisitic expectations of service despite their actions and how you can treat random people trying to help you as someone below you then belittle them.  I can go on about numerous times I've faced people like that in my past working days.

      I don't often fight with friends. I like to keep good relationships if possible, and if something goes wrong or words are exchanged, I usually just let it go. I am not one to create a grudge over small things. There was only one time when someone wronged me past the point of return, and I came to the conclusion that they add more of a negative effect on my life than positive.

      There was one time when I was trying to be understanding about a friend's brother's diagnosis with cancer. I've had cancer within my family, lost family members to it, and have been through the journey with them. It was misunderstanding that led to it, then his lack of reaching out to me to let me know what he thought and how he felt. I eventually heard from a mutual friend about why he had suddenly cut me from his life. Luckily, it was a friend who knew me well, and came to say that 'She did not mean it in that way what-so-ever.' I only wanted to be supportive of him, say that we can talk about it if he wants to, otherwise, I will not bring it up since it's not place to dig up heavy situations unless the person feels that they could use someone to talk to about it. I felt terrible that he had misunderstood my words. I tried to clear the air and let him know that I was only coming from a place of friendship and support. I had phrased the wording in a bad manner, so I took responsibility of that. However, my intentions were not to belittle the situation in anyway. It was more of a way that I can understand after having gone through it a couple times. It ultimately hurt our friendship, but things are better now. We haven't really talked about it since some people are open about those things. He has moved away, but generally things are alright now. I never mean to offend anyone, and if I have, I'd like to be told in a civil manner so it can be discussed and any misunderstandings can be cleared up. I've learned that this might be the equation I was looking for many years in terms of conflicts dealing with misunderstanding and then silence - usually leaving one person in the dark of why things have suddenly changed.
